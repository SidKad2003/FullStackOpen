Here we see the basic structuring and functioning of a react app:
we talk abt Components, JSX and Props


components are function(or class) having content returned as a JSX which after compiling (see Babel) renders the HTML
that is to be shown on browser
Babel is a compilier in short, look on net for more

XML(Extensible Markup Language)  is like HTML, but one can define custom tags. JSX is nothing but a XML 
language
