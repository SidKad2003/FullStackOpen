This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single-page 
applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with 
Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous integration.

Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, 
and databases.

Prerequisites
Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, 
and know the basics of the Git version control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for 
solving problems and seeking information independently.

Previous knowledge of JavaScript or other course topics is not required.

In parts 1-4 you are expected to do at least all of the exercises that are not marked with an asterisk(*). Exercises 
marked with an asterisk count towards your final grade, but skipping them does not prevent you from doing the 
compulsory exercises in the next parts. Parts 5- do not have asterisk marked exercises since there is no similar 
dependency on previous parts.
